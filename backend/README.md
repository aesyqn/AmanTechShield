# AmanTech Shield Backend

This folder contains backend placeholders for the 5 main security modules:

1. Penetration Test Simulation – `src/modules/penTest`
2. Advanced Phishing Detection – `src/modules/phishing`
3. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) – `src/modules/ids`
4. Risk Scoring with Islamic Ethics – `src/modules/risk`
5. Recovery & Disclosure Plan – `src/modules/reporting`

Each module has:
- A controller file exporting an Express router.
- A feature-specific README with free/free-tier tool suggestions and API design.

For your group assignment you can implement **only what you need**:
- If you just demo, keep the 501 responses.
- If you add real logic, follow each module README to wire routes, services, and (optionally) a free-tier Postgres DB.
